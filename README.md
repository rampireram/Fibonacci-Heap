Fibonacci-Heap
==============

Implementation of Fibonacci Heap in C

This is my first project in GitHub.

The following procedures have been implemented in this project.
1.insert_into_root_list   //method to insert a node into the root list
2.insert_into_child_list  //method to insert a node into another node's child list
3.remove_from_root_list   //method to remove a node from the root list
4.insert                  //method to initialize a node to insert it into the root list
5.view_root_list          //method to view the nodes in the root list
6.view_child_list         //method to view the nodes in child list of a node
7.fib_heap_link           //method to link a node to another node's child list
8.consolidate             //auxilary method for "extract_min"
9.extract_min             //method to extract the minimal node from the list
10.heap_init              //method to initialize the heap struct

Methods to be implemented yet.
a.Decrease_key
b.Delete a node from the list

Any suggestions to improve the code and its efficiency are welcome.
